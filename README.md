# YOUTUBE CLONE
A static frontend clone of the YouTube homepage, built to practice modern web layout techniques. This project replicates the visual design and responsiveness of YouTube's desktop interface.

## 📱 App Overview & Features

This project is a pixel-perfect recreation of the YouTube homepage UI. It focuses on structure, layout, and styling without functional backend logic.

* **Responsive Header:** Includes the hamburger menu, search bar with hover effects, voice search icon, and user navigation icons (upload, apps, notifications).
* **Sidebar Navigation:** A fixed left-hand sidebar featuring navigation categories like Home, Explore, Subscriptions, and Library.
* **Video Grid Layout:** A responsive grid system that displays video thumbnails, duration overlays, channel profile pictures, video titles, and metadata (views, upload date).
* **Hover Effects:** Interactive states on buttons, video thumbnails, and navigation items to mimic the native YouTube experience.
* **External Linking:** Video cards link directly to the actual YouTube videos.

## Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for the navbar, sidebar, and video grid.
* **CSS3:**
    * **Flexbox:** Used for the header layout (aligning the left menu, center search, and right icons) and video card details.
    * **CSS Grid:** Used for the main video gallery to ensure a responsive grid that adjusts columns based on screen size.
    * **Positioning:** Absolute and relative positioning used for tooltips, notification counts, and video duration overlays.
